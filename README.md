# My Personal Project: Mineral Wiki

## Overview

My personal project will be a mineral database that allows users to view minerals, their
important properties and will allow them to search and filter minerals based on these
properties. 

The program should also provide suggested similar minerals and should provide a way to 
navigate through mineral families. For example the **feldspar** mineral group should refer to entries
of common minerals in the feldspar family. *Finally*, I plan on allowing users to upload images of 
these minerals to these individual entries. 

## Who could use this

This project could be of use to:

1. Collectors of gems and minerals
2. Geology enthusiasts
3. People looking for data or properties of specific materials

I have always been interested in minerals and geology and would find a resource
like this very useful for learning about new minerals. 

## User Stories

- *As a user*, I would like to add minerals that are not included in the database
- *As a user*, I would like to be able to search and view minerals by name, chemical composition and other important properties
- *As a user*, I would like to view images of these minerals and upload my own
- *As a user*, I would like for the ability to add short entries on a mineral's page
